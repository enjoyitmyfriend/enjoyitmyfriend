Hi there ðŸ‘‹
=
* Here is the demo of HTML<br>
http://etonhouse-dg.top/webpage_design/Metta/index.html

* You can change the last second part behind the / to open your webpage where there has a folder named after you stored all your materials
<br>e.g. http://etonhouse-dg.top/webpage_design/Darren/index.html

* Here are the materials you will use <br>
https://github.com/enjoyitmyfriend/Materials

* I bought the domain server so that you could visit your webpage online by etonhouse-dg.top, but one day it will expire so at that time you should use the original address to access the webpage.
<br>e.g. http://enjoyitmyfriend.github.io/enjoyitmyfriend/webpage_design/Metta/index.html
