<p>Superheroes have many different super powers. Most of them have the same aim though, to protect the public and to fight crime. Most superheroes will have a villain as their nemesis, someone they are always trying to save the world from.
</p>
<p>The word superhero is a very old word and can be dated back to as early as 1917. Most of the superheroes we know today were created in comic books. Some of these date back to as early as the 1930s.
