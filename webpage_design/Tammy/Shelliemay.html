	Shelliemay is the Disney Bear plush stuffed animal, inspired by her appearance in Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty animated film (1959) including a black nylon headdress with plush filled horns and a black nylon gown with integrated collar, purple satin lining and flaring dagged sleeves resembling flames both featuring purple and magenta embroidered accents and attaching with black velcro. </br></br>

	Background Storie:</br>
	Mickey and Duffy have returned from their long voyage. "Hi, Minnie! We're back!"</br> 
	Mickey and Minnie are such good friends. "Mickey, tell me all about your voyage!""Gee, I wish I had a best friend, too!" thought Duffy, "We'd sure have fun."</br>
	"Be my friend!" Duffy put a message in a bottle and set it adrift in the ocean. "Oh-oh! It's Duffy's bottle! Better deliver it quick!" TippyBlue, the postman, is always in a rush. "I found Duffy's bottle in the ocean!" called out TippyBlue. "Oh, Duffy¡­ I guess he's been lonely," thought Minnie. "Well, I've got a good idea!"</br>
	Minnie is making a friend for Duffy. "I'm sure this'll make him happy!" smiled Minnie.</br>
	Duffy was a little shy when he saw Minnie's present. Because there in front of him was a sweet, little girl.</br> 
	"Let's be friends!" said Duffy as he gave her a seashell. It was a treasure he'd found. The heart-shaped seashell pendant was so charming!</br>
	"That's it! I'll name you ShellieMay!" said Minnie. "Hi, ShellieMay!" "Let's be friends, Duffy!"</br>This is ShellieMay. She lives in Cape Cod and always happily plays with Duffy.
