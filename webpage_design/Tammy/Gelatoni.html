	Background Story:</br>
	One day while visiting Italy on their spring voyage, Duffy and Mickey were out for a stroll while Minnie and ShellieMay did some shopping. Suddenly...</br>
	"Oh no! My gelato!" cried Duffy, as his sweet treat plopped to the ground.</br>
	"Va bene, don't worry," said the green tuxedo cat in the bright blue beret. "Ciao! I'm Gelatoni." And the funny little cat dipped his tail in the melting gelato and began painting with it. Duffy smiled and said, "I'm Duffy."</br>
	"I wanna paint, too!" Duffy cheered. "Certamente, Duffy! Let's paint together!" replied Gelatoni.</br>
	After they finished, the two new friends happily exchanged their masterpieces. "Let's play again sometime!" they both agreed.</br>
	This is Gelatoni. He lives in Mediterranean Harbor and loves to draw pictures.
