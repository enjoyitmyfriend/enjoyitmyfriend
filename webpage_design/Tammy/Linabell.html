	Background Story:</br>
	One day, on an outing, Mickey and Duffy got separated following butterflies.</br>
	A fox passed by, "What's wrong?"</br>
	"I can't find my way back"</br>
	"Hmm. Sticky seed. Butterfly. Orchid. Got it. I can bring you back!"</br>
	"Wow, you're amazing!"</br>
	Excited to be reunited with Mickey, Duffy said, "She is really smart!", and gave her an orchid. "My name is LinaBell and I love solving mysteries."</br>
	What mysteries will you solve with LinaBell?
