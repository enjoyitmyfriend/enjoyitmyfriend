	Background Story:</br>
	As Mickey Mouse and his pal Duffy were sailing the islands for a perfect birthday present for ShellieMay, they could hear the sounds of a ukulele calling them over to a cove where a kindhearted turtle named 'Olu played happy tunes.</br>
	'Olu greeted Duffy with a smile and said, "I play my 'ukulele to make songs of love. Want to sing with me?"</br>
	"That will be the perfect present for ShellieMay!" said Duffy. </br>
	Off to her birthday party, they went, singing the special song of friendship and love.
