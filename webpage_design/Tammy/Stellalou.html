	Background story:</br> 
	One day, Duffy came to American Waterfront and saw a little girl bunny named StellaLou who was practicing a dance in front of the S.S. Columbia. When she stumbled, Duffy called out to her in concern. StellaLou told Duffy that she dreamed of becoming a dancer. Duffy thought that a dream was just something you had when sleeping, but StellaLou explained that a dream is also seeing what you want to be when you grow up. StellaLou was practicing so hard, Duffy was sure her dream would come true.This is StellaLou. Her dream is to become a dancer and performer in New York.
