<h1>Charity event information</h1>

<p>We hold a monthly charity event at a local school. The event is a food market that allows local bee keepers to sell their honey and any homemade goodies such as cakes and sweet treats.</P
<p>We would love to see you at our next event!</p>
<p>We also hold a yearly charity event that children can attend and play lots of games to learn about the importance of bees to our society.</p>
<p>We will post further information about this event at a later stage.</p>
