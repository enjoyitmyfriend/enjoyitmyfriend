	According to the real-time data provided by Maoyan, the box office of the film broke 204 million on the day of its release, and the next day's box office reached as high as 407 million.</br> 
	"Changjin Lake" deserves such dazzling results. Of course, this is thanks to the actors, directors and behind-the-scenes workers.</br> 
	Among them, the most surprising audience is Yi Yangqian, who is not Wu Wanli.</br> 
	Xi is none other than. In fact, in contrast, Yi Yang Qianxi is not the one with the most scenes, but the role of Wu Wanli in the film is of great significance.</br> 
	In that special era, in order to protect the family and the country, and for the sake of national justice, there were many children who carried guns and went to the battlefield in their teens.</br>  
	Their names may have been left in the long river of history, or their names may have been due to various reasons.</br> 
	Unknown, and Wu Wanli is the epitome of these tens of thousands of little heroes.</br>
